== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How often should I sync my links? =

We recommend syncing your links weekly or after making significant content changes to your website.

= Does this plugin slow down my website? =

No, the plugin only runs scans when you manually trigger them or schedule them. It doesn't affect your website's front-end performance.

= Can I schedule automatic scans? =

The current version requires manual syncing, but automatic scheduling is planned for future releases.

= What types of links are detected? =

The plugin detects all HTML anchor tags (`<a>` tags) with href attributes in your post and page content.

= How are broken links determined? =

The plugin sends HTTP requests to external URLs and checks response codes. 404, 410, DNS errors, and timeout errors are considered broken links.
